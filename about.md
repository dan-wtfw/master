Daniel Schultz has been an ordained minister in the <a href="http://www.ucc.org">United Church of Christ</a> since 1999. He has served mostly small, mostly rural congregations in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He currently teaches theology and works for a non-profit organization that seeks to increase civic engagement on college campuses. None of his employers are responsible for what he says.

A prolific blogger and writer, Dan has been published in *The Christian Century, Congregations, The Guardian, The Progressive Christian, The Revealer, Killing The Buddha*, and <a href="https://rewire.news/religion-dispatches/">Religion Dispatches</a>, where he serves as a Contributing Editor. In 2005, he established the Street Prophets community in partnership with Markos Moulitsas of <a href="http://dailykos.com">Daily Kos</a>.

In his spare time, Dan enjoys <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rev.daniel.schultz/">photography</a>, reading about archaeology, and cookies. He has expensive tastes in beer. He lives in Wisconsin with his wife Jennifer, his son Bill, his extremely photogenic dog Taco, and three cats. He wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Script-Authentically-Progressive-Political/dp/1935439146/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525112986&sr=8-1&keywords=Changing+The+Script">a book</a> a few years ago that he prefers not to talk about.

*The Word For The Week* is the stripped-down successor to the short-lived podcast *Stranger Jesus*. This site collects posts from the SJ blog, as well as from *A Pastor's Notebook*, a more personal blog. The site is built on [Centrarium][centrarium], a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra]. Many thanks to him for putting it out on github.
